## Lindenmeyer System

I find fractals to be really interesting, and
[Lindenmayer systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system)
are a great way to describe them in computer friendly terms.
They work by using an alphabet of symbols that have an operation
associated with them, and rules on how to generate the next set of symbols.

I built this app a few years ago to play around with generating fractals.
There are a few preset fractals available to give a sense of how everything works.

The source code is available at https://github.com/Jon-Hirsch/lindenmeyer-system
