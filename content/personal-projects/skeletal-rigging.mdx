## Skeletal Rigging

A few years back I spent some time studying game programming in C++ and C#.
One of the topics I spent time playing with was skeletal animation. The basic
idea of skeletal animation is that a model can have bones, and when a bone
moves, it also effects the positioning of any bones attached to it. I decided
it could be interesting to take what I'd worked with in a 3d environment in C#
and see how it would translate into 2d in JavaScript. I ended up with this
posable stickman. Drag the circles to pose him.
