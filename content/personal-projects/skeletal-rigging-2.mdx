## Skeletal Rigging 2.0

I've expanded on my original [skeletal rigging](/personal-projects/skeletal-rigging)
project and added in some dynamic controls built with React and Redux. You can now
add/remove bones, and position them with the controls below the canvas.

The source code can be found here: https://github.com/Jon-Hirsch/SkeletalRigging2.0
