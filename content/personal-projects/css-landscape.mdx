## CSS Landscape

I've always been impressed when people are able to use CSS to create complex shapes and art.
I also always like when CSS is combined with JavaScript to create interesting parallax effects.
I decided it would be fun to combine the concepts, and have a parallax CSS landscape that was
generated by JavaScript.

This is what I ended up with:

<div id="css-landscape-container" class="game-container"></div>
What you see is rendered using only CSS and DOM elements, no images, no
canvases.
