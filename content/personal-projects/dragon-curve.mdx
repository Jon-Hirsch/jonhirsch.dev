## Dragon Curve

This is a simple canvas app to generate [dragon curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve) fractals. Play
around with the controls at the bottom to control the number of iterations and the
colors used in the fractal. A quick word of warning in advance though, the fractals
look awesome at higher iterations, but after about 15 or so they start taking a while
to render, as the number of lines drawn starts going into the millions.
