## Hunter

I usually try to avoid writing JavaScript in an Object Oriented style with classes,
inheritance, and all the rest. I've found a that functional style just tends to work
well for me. That said, there are some situations where I still find OOP useful in
JavaScript. One of them is when I want to create game objects to render on a canvas.
This was one exercise in writing in a more Object Oriented style.
