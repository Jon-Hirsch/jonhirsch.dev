##### State

In the last section we saw how props could greatly expand what a component could
render. By setting props to different values, we could dramatically change how a
component looked or what it displayed. Despite all this, the components were still
fairly static and couldn't change once the props had been set. That can be alright
for components that don't respond to user interaction, but what if we need a more
interactive component? This is where component state comes in.

Like props, state is series of variables that can be used to control a component.
There are however, two major differences. First is that while props are passed to
a component from an external source, state is set internally within a component.
Second is that props are immutable, meaning that the component that they are passed
to cannot change them, but a component is capable of modifying its own state in
response to events that occur. Let's take a look at a simple example of what state can do.

<div id="example1" />

As you might imagine, state opens up a host of possibilities for what we can do with React.
Unfortunately, it is also very easy to use state incorrectly. With this in mind I will be
covering state in two separate parts. In the first part I'll be going over the basics of
how to implement and use state in a component, and in the second I'll go over when it is
and is not appropriate to use state, as well as some of the common pitfalls to avoid.

Let's take a look at the code for the example above:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import "./css/counter.css";

export default function Counter() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  function incrementCounter() {
    setCounter(counter + 1);
  }

  function decrementCounter() {
    setCounter(counter - 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button className="counterButton" onClick={decrementCounter}>
        -
      </button>
      <span className="counterNumber">{counter}</span>
      <button className="counterButton" onClick={incrementCounter}>
        +
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

As you can see on the first line, we are importing a new function from React called
useState. useState is what is called a hook. React defines a hook as
"a special function that lets you 'hook into' React features". useState will create
a state variable that will be preserved between calls to our component function. So
for instance, if I set counter to 5 it will stay set to 5, even if our component is
re-rendered.

lets take a look at how we initialize a state variable:

```jsx
const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
```

Every time we call useState, it will return two variables in an array that can be assigned
whatever names we like. The first variable is the actual state value we will be working with,
in our example we call this counter. The second is a function that is used to change the state
value. We could name this whatever we want, but convention is to name it "set" followed by
whatever piece of state it will be changing. In our case, that means we will name the function
"setCounter". Finally, you probably noticed that we passed "0" to useState. This is the starting
value for our piece of state.

Now that we have our counter variable stored in state, we want to increment or decrement it whenever
our buttons are clicked. As you can see, we have set up standard onClick event listeners on our
buttons, that call our two functions for changing our counter:

```jsx
function incrementCounter() {
  setCounter(counter + 1);
}

function decrementCounter() {
  setCounter(counter - 1);
}
```

So here we are able to update our state variable by calling setCounter with a new value. In this
case we want to set the new value to either be one more or one less than the current value. However,
we could just as easily have a function to set the state to an arbitrary value if we so desired:

```jsx
function setCounterToFive() {
  setCounter(5);
}
```

At this point you might be wondering why we aren't just assigning a new value to counter like so:

```jsx
function incrementCounter() {
  counter = counter + 1;
}

function decrementCounter() {
  counter = counter - 1;
}

function setCounterToFive() {
  counter = 5;
}
```

The reason is that the plain variable has no way of hooking into React's features. We can assign
a new value to it, but it will not cause the actual component state to update, nor will it cause
the component to re-render with the new value. When we call setCounter it lets React know to
update state and render the component.

So thats all it takes to set up a basic state variable for a React component. Lets go through
another example to reinforce what we have covered. This time, we will have two state variables
that will contain values other than numbers:

<div id="example2"></div>

In this example you can see that you can type a message to be displayed, and choose how large
you would like that message to be. We are walk through building this example bit by bit. To
start, we need a new component:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

export default function StateExample() {
  return <div></div>;
}
```

Once that is done, we will want to add two pieces of state. One for the message, and one for the size.

```jsx
const [message, setMessage] = useState("");
const [messageSize, setMessageSize] = useState("large");
```

We will need a couple of functions for handling user input and updating state as well:

```jsx
function handleMessageChange(event) {
  setMessage(event.target.value);
}

function handleSizeChange(event) {
  setMessageSize(event.target.value);
}
```

We will need to render the inputs that will be used to change the state:

```jsx
return (
  <div>
    <div>
      Enter a message: <input type="text" onChange={handleMessageChange} />
    </div>
    <span>Choose a message size: </span>
    <select onChange={handleSizeChange}>
      <option>large</option>
      <option>medium</option>
      <option>small</option>
    </select>
  </div>
);
```

Now we need to actually render the output somewhere. For this example, we are
actually going to be using a second component. It's important to understand that
state in a parent component can actually be passed down to a child component as props.
Thats what we are going to be doing in this example.

```jsx
function Message(props) {
  if (props.messageSize === "large") {
    return <h1>{props.message}</h1>;
  } else if (props.messageSize === "medium") {
    return <h3>{props.message}</h3>;
  } else {
    return <h5>{props.message}</h5>;
  }
}
```

Note: This component can actually be stored in the same file. As a convention, I try
to only have one exported component per file, but sometimes making small sub components
that aren't exported can be helpful for organization.

Finally, the parent StateExample component will need to render the child Message component.
We will go back to the JSX for StateComponent and add in the Message like so:

```jsx
<div>
  <div>
    Enter a message: <input type="text" onChange={handleMessageChange} />
  </div>
  <span>Choose a message size: </span>
  <select onChange={handleSizeChange}>
    <option>large</option>
    <option>medium</option>
    <option>small</option>
  </select>
  <Message messageSize={messageSize} message={message} />
</div>
```

Thats all there is. You can see that StateComponent initializes our state variables
and updates them based on user input. It then passes those variables to Message as
props, and Message decides what to render based on what has been passed to it.

The completed file looks like this:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

export default function StateExample() {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState("");
  const [messageSize, setMessageSize] = useState("large");

  function handleMessageChange(event) {
    setMessage(event.target.value);
  }

  function handleSizeChange(event) {
    setMessageSize(event.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        Enter a message: <input type="text" onChange={handleMessageChange} />
      </div>
      <span>Choose a message size: </span>
      <select onChange={handleSizeChange}>
        <option>large</option>
        <option>medium</option>
        <option>small</option>
      </select>
      <Message messageSize={messageSize} message={message} />
    </div>
  );
}

function Message(props) {
  if (props.messageSize === "large") {
    return <h1>{props.message}</h1>;
  } else if (props.messageSize === "medium") {
    return <h3>{props.message}</h3>;
  } else {
    return <h5>{props.message}</h5>;
  }
}
```

That just about wraps up this intro to React. There is a lot more that could be said
about more advanced topics like context, effects, data managerment, etc, but hopefully
this guide was helpful in demystifying some of the core ideas behind React.

Before you go, I've got [one last exercise](/articles/react-part-5-exercise-1) to practice
working with state.
