  - Exercise 1

##### Shape Picker

Time for one last exercise. Like the last two exercises begin by cloning/forking this
repository: https://github.com/Jon-Hirsch/react-part-5-exercise-1 and installing the
dependencies.

For this exercise, you will be rewriting App.js to contain a pair of select elements
that will allow you to control what kind of shape is displayed:

<div id="example1"></div>

Shape.js and ShapeList.js will be the same as the [last exercise](/articles/react-part-4-exercise-2),
so you can simply copy the code over into your new project. No changes needed.

##### Requirements

##### App.js

- It should contain two select elements
- The first select element should control the color of the Shape component
- The second select element should control the shape of the Shape component
