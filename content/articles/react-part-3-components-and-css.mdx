##### Import Statements

Before we dive into writing components, I want to take a little time to take a closer look at import
statements. I talk about them briefly in part 2, but I didn't really go into much detail. Imports are an
important part of React projects because they allow us to separate and organize our code across multiple
files that can be bundled together by Webpack or other bundlers. They are the means by which our bundler
knows which files to include in our bundle, and which files to exclude. This gives us a great deal of
control over exactly what is brought into our projects. Furthermore, imports allow us to better control
the scope of where specific pieces our code are accessible within our project.

There are several ways import can be used. The first is what we saw back in part 2:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello World</h1>, document.getElementById("app"));
```

In this example we were importing the entire react and reactDOM libraries in from our npm_modules folder.
For the case of packages installed via npm, we only need to list the name of the package, and Webpack
will be able to figure out the rest on its own.

The syntax for importing code from a file you have written as opposed to a package you have installed is
mostly the same but has one important difference. When importing from your own files you cannot simply
use a name like you would for a package as Webpack would not know how to find that file. Instead, you use
a relative path. For example, if I wanted to import code from a file named App.js in a folder named components
I might write an import statement that looked like this:

```jsx
import App from "./components/App";
```

If not otherwise specified the default export will be used, but there are times when you want to import a
specific part of a package. For example, if you wanted to import the useState function from react your import
statement would look like this:

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
```

##### Exports

Just as we have import statements, we also have exports. Exports will flag a piece of code as being capable of
being imported. Valid types of exports include variables, objects, and functions. As an example let's say we have
a utility file called utils.js with two functions we want to export. It might look something like this:

```jsx
export default function doSomething() {
  console.log("do something");
}

export function doSomethingElse() {
  console.log("do something else");
}
```

And then to use those functions in another file you would write:

```jsx
import doSomething, { doSomethingElse } from "./utils";

doSomething();
doSomethingElse();
```

You probably noticed the differences between how the two functions are being imported and exported. First,
the function doSomething has the keyword default after export, while doSomethingElse does not. Secondly,
when they are imported doSomethingElse is wrapped in braces, while doSomething is not.

The difference between a plain export and a default export is that a file will only have one default export,
and that is what will be imported if nothing is specifically targeted using braces. Any non-default exports
must be specified within braces when they are imported.

##### Components

Okay, now that we've got all the groundwork laid out, we can finally really start digging into React. Components
are really the core of what React is and does, and they let us break up our website into small manageable chunks.
Let's start by replacing the h1 tags you wrote in part 2 with a component. First, you will want to make a new
directory in your src folder called components. Inside that directory make a new file called HelloWorld.js.
In HelloWorld.js type the following:

```jsx
import React from "react";

export default function HelloWorld() {
  return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
}
```

Now, open index.js and update to look like this:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./components/HelloWorld";

ReactDOM.render(<HelloWorld />, document.getElementById("app"));
```

When that is done, run webpack, and open index.html in your browser. What you should see is essentially the same as
what you had at the end of part 2:

<div id="example1"></div>

The difference is that this time you've accomplished the result using a component. I know that isn't terribly
impressive right now, but don't worry, our components will start becoming more complex very shortly. For now,
let's focus on what's going on inside the component you just wrote.

So the first thing we see is that we are creating a function called HelloWorld. This is going to serve as a template
for any HelloWorld components we create later. It will contain all the instructions needed to render HelloWorld components
as well as any behaviors those components might have. We don't have any behaviors or special rendering instructions
right now, but that's fine, not all components need to be complex.

The most basic components are functions that just return a block of plain JSX, but it's also possible to add
variables into the mix like so:

```jsx
function HelloWorld() {
  const myVar = "Hello World!";
  return <h1>{myVar}</h1>;
}
```

One last important thing to know about your component whatever JSX it returns should be wrapped within a single
set of tags. That means that the following is valid:

```jsx
function HelloWorld() {
  const myVar = "Hello World!";
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{myVar}</h1>
      <h1>{myVar}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

But the same code with the wrapping div removed would not be valid, and would throw an error when you attempted to compile it.

Alright, you've seen the basics of what a component is, so what can you do once you have made a component? Well, one of the
most important features of components is that they are reusable. That means you and write a component once, and reuse it as many
times and in as many places as you like. As a very simple example, change index.js to look like this:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./components/HelloWorld";

ReactDOM.render(
  <div>
    <HelloWorld />
    <HelloWorld />
    <HelloWorld />
  </div>,
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

You should see the component being rendered three times like so:

<div id="example2"></div>

The next major feature of components to understand is that they can contain
other components. It is the nature of React projects that larger components are
almost always composed of several smaller ones. In fact, most projects will have
one high level component that contains all the other components. Such a
component is frequently given the name App or other similar names. Let's go
ahead and make a new component called App now. Add a new file to your components
directory called App.js and add the following:

```jsx
import React from "react";
export default function App() {
  return <div></div>;
}
```

Leave the div empty for now, we are going to come back shortly and add some components.
Now open index.js and update it to the following:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./components/App";

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("app"));
```

Okay, now let's make a new component. This time let's do something a little bit more
interesting than just a plain hello world message. We'll start with a simple navigation
bar like the one on the top right of this page. Make a new file in the components
directory called NavBar.js and in it write the following:

```jsx
import React from "react";

export default function NavBar() {
  return (
    <div>
      <a href="/">Home</a>
      <a href="/personal-projects">Personal Projects</a>
      <a href="/articles">Articles</a>
      <a href="/search">Search</a>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now that we have a couple components, reopen App.js and import HelloWorld and NavBar.
Add a few instances of each component into the returned JSX like so:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import HelloWorld from "./HelloWorld";
import NavBar from "./NavBar";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <NavBar />
      <HelloWorld />
      <HelloWorld />
      <HelloWorld />
      <NavBar />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Run Webpack and take a look at what you've got. If everything worked correctly it should look like this:

<div id="example3"></div>

Hopefully you are beginning to see how reusable components could be useful when building a website.

##### Adding CSS

The example above was functional, but the NavBar wasn't terribly interesting to look at. Let's try
adding some CSS to our component to make it look a bit nicer. The first thing we will need to do
is install some loaders for handling CSS. Just like how we needed loaders for Webpack to work with
Babel and React, we will want loaders to let it know how to handle CSS files. Open your command
line and type:

```bash
npm i style-loader css-loader --save-dev
```

Once the loaders are installed open up webpack.config. Update the rules section so that the code
looks like this:

```js
rules: [
    {
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        loader: "babel-loader",
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        options: {
            presets: ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"],
        },
    },
    {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"],
    },
],
```

Webpack will now know how to load CSS. Let's write the css now. Make a new folder in the components
directory called css and in it create a new file called navbar.css. Type this css into the file:

```css
@import url(http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Quicksand:300,400,700);

.navbar {
  display: inline-block;
  background-color: #222748;
  padding: 5px;
}

.navbar--link {
  display: inline-block;
  font-family: "Quicksand";
  text-decoration: none;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 16px;
  padding: 4px;
  margin: 2px;
  border-radius: 1px;
  border: solid 1px #fff;
  color: #fff;
  background-color: #222748;
  transition: color 0.4s, background-color 0.4s, border-color 0.4s;
}

.navbar--link:hover {
  border-color: #222748;
  color: #222748;
  background-color: #fff;
}
```

Let's do a bit of updating to NavBar.js. First, you will want to import the css
file you just created. Importing css looks a little different, in that you simply
type import followed by the path to the file. After that you will want to add the
classes to the containing div and links. When working in JSX you will need to use
the property className instead of class in order to avoid confusion with the JavaScript
class keyword.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import "./css/navbar.css";

export default function NavBar() {
  return (
    <div className="navbar">
      <a className="navbar--link" href="/">
        Home
      </a>
      <a className="navbar--link" href="/personal-projects">
        Personal Projects
      </a>
      <a className="navbar--link" href="/articles">
        Articles
      </a>
      <a className="navbar--link" href="/search">
        Search
      </a>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Run webpack again and take a look at the output. It should look like this:

<div id="example4"></div>

That just about wraps things up for this section. In [part 4](/articles/react-part-4-props) I will explain how to make
components far more flexible and powerful using props. The completed code for this section
