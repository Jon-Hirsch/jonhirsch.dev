In the last section, we started a project and installed NPM and Webpack.
In this section we will be looking at two more prerequisites for getting a
React project going: JSX and Babel. We will take a look at what these are,
and then see how to install them. After that, we will install React, and write
our very first bit of React code.

##### JSX

The first piece I want to talk about is JSX. JSX is another one of Facebook's creations, and is
complementary to React. JSX is an extension to JavaScript that lets you write tags
(both standard HTML tags, and custom React tags) straight into your JavaScript. What that means is
that generating HTML with JavaScript becomes a whole lot easier.

For example, if I wanted to use plain JavaScript to create an input element the code might look
something like this:

```js
const element = document.createElement("input");
element.type = "text";
element.name = "inputField";
element.className = "inputClass";
element.value = "default";
```

But with JSX, the code can be simplified down to:

```jsx
const element = (
  <input type="text" name="inputField" className="inputClass" value="default" />
);
```

The benefits become even more pronounced when you begin nesting elements. Again, here is what code might look
like with plain JavaScript:

```js
const element = document.createElement("input");
element.type = "text";
element.name = "inputField";
element.className = "inputClass";
element.value = "default";
const div = document.createElement("div");
div.className = "container-div";
div.appendChild(element);
```

And here it is with JSX:

```jsx
const element = (
  <div className="container-div">
    <input
      type="text"
      name="inputField"
      className="inputClass"
      value="default"
    />
  </div>
);
```

As you can see, this is a much more natural way of generating your HTML. Additionally,
JSX makes it easy to pass data into the tags being created. Say for instance, that in the
previous example, you wanted the value to contain some data that was stored in a variable.
JSX lets you insert variables and other JavaScript statements by wrapping them in {}. For
Example:

```jsx
const myValue = "Hello World";
const element = (
  <div>
    <input
      type="text"
      name="inputField"
      className="inputClass"
      value={myValue}
    />
  </div>
);
```

It is worth noting that it is technically possible to write React without JSX. However,
not using it would defeat a lot of the purpose of using React, and you really don't see
any React projects that aren't taking advantage of JSX.

##### Babel

At this point, you may be wondering how we are going to use JSX, seeing that browsers do
not natively support it. This is where Babel comes in. Babel is a JavaScript compiler that
can take things like ES6 and JSX and translate them into JavaScript that is currently understood
by browers. It will work alongside Webpack to take all our code and compile and bundle it into a
single file our web browser can run.

##### Installing JSX and Babel

Now that we know the tools we need, let's see how to go about installing them. You will need to
use npm to download a few packages. Type the following commands:

```bash
npm i @babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react --save-dev
```

```bash
npm i react react-dom
```

Let's quickly go over what each of those is.

- **@babel/core**: the base package for Babel.
- **babel-loader**: this package will allow Webpack to run Babel when it
  bundles our files.
- **@babel/preset-env**: allows us to use the latest JavaScript syntax that may
  need to be transformed for full browser support.
- **babel-preset-react**: allows Babel to compile React into plain JavaScript.
- **react**: React.
- **react-dom**: renders React components into the DOM.

Once you have finished installing the packages, open package.json and take a look at what's changed. It
should look something like this (the version numbers may be different):

```js
{
  "name": "react-boilerplate",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "a react project boilerplate",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "build": "webpack --mode production"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.17.10",
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.17.10",
    "@babel/preset-react": "^7.16.7",
    "babel-loader": "^8.2.5",
    "webpack": "^5.72.1",
    "webpack-cli": "^4.9.2"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.1.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.1.0"
  }
}
```

You may have also noticed a new folder in your project called node_modules. This is where all your packages
are actually installed. If you open it up, you should see all the packages you just installed. You shouldn't
need to make any changes to them, but it is worth knowing where they are stored.

##### Configuring Webpack

There is one last step we need to complete before we can start writing React. We need to set up our Webpack
configuration to know how to read in the correct babel presets. Go into your webpack.config.js file and update
it to look like this:

```js
module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/index.js",
  output: {
    path: __dirname + "/dist",
    filename: "bundle.js",
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        loader: "babel-loader",
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        options: {
          presets: ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"],
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

Let's break down the rules section you just added.

- **test**: This is a regular expression that tells Webpack which files to run Babel
  on. In this case, we want it to run for files ending in .js and .jsx
- **loader**: Loaders are packages used to transform code. In this case, we want our js and jsx files tranformed by Babel.
- **exclude**: Folders to ignore. We don't want Babel running on the packages we have installed.
- **presets**: This contains the presets we installed earlier. These presets tell Babel what kind of transformations to apply.

##### React

Alright, all the necessary groundwork has been laid and you are finally ready to start writing some React code! Open up
index.js again and write the following code:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello World</h1>, document.getElementById("app"));
```

The first thing here is the import statements. You can use these imports to bring in npm packages you have installed or files you
have written. These statements will give you access to any code those files export. There is a bit more going on than that, but
for now it will suffice to know the import statements are a big part of how Webpack will know what to include in the bundle.
The next section here is ReactDOM.render. This function handles taking jsx/react elements and rendering them into the DOM. The
first argument it accepts is what you want rendered. The second argument is the element it will render into.

Go ahead and run Webpack now. If everything was set up correctly, your files should be bundled successfully. Now we just need one
last step to be able to see the code run. Open up your dist folder, and create a new file named index.html. In that file,
write the following:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head> </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script src="bundle.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Save the file, and then open it with your browser of choice. If everything worked correctly, you should see the header rendered
on the page.

Congratulations! You've gotten a React project up and running. This is pretty good stopping point for now, so I'll
leave off here. In [part 3](/articles/react-part-3-components-and-css) I'll spend some more time talking about import, and I'll
introduce the real heart of React: components. My full code is available here: https://github.com/Jon-Hirsch/react-boilerplate-part-2
