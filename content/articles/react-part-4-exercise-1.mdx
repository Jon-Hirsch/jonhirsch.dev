##### Exercise 1: Shape Component

Alright, it's time for something a little different. I knew when I began writing these tutorials
that I wanted to create some exercises to really help reinforce the concepts I was writing about.
I taught programming classes for several years, so writing exercises is a familiar topic to me,
but I was always physically present to answer students' questions about requirements and to correct
their work. I wondered for a while about how to overcome this limitation, and an idea occurred to
me: I could write a suite of unit tests to describe the requirements and to validate completed code.
With that in mind, I've created some github repos with partially completed projects along with a suite
of unit tests.

To begin head to: https://github.com/Jon-Hirsch/react-part-4-exercise-1 and clone or fork the repository.
Once you have a copy of the project on your computer run

```bash
npm i
```

to install of the necessary dependencies.

For this exercise, all the initial setup and configuration is already taken care of for you,
but if you look in the components directory you will see there are two empty files: App.js and Shape.js.
You will be creating these two components.

Shape.js will contain a component that renders colored shapes, and App.js will render three of these Shape
components: a blue square, a red diamond, and a green circle.

<div id="app"></div>

I've included all the css classes necessary to accomplish this in the styles.css file. The shapes can be
created by simply applying the correct classes to a div. For instance:

```jsx
<div className="red circle"></div>
```

will generate:

<div id="example1"></div>

The component itself would look like this:

```jsx
<Shape color="red" shape="circle" />
```

##### Requirements

##### Shape.js

- It should render a div
- It should apply the class red to the div if the color property is "red"
- It should apply the class green to the div if the color property is "green"
- It should apply the class blue to the div if the color property is "blue"
- It should apply the class red to the div if the color property is not set
- It should apply the class red to the div if the color property is any other value
- It should apply the class square to the div if the shape property is "square"
- It should apply the class diamond to the div if the shape property is "diamond"
- It should apply the class circle to the div if the shape property is "circle"
- It should apply the class square to the div if the shape property is not set
- It should apply the class square to the div if the shape property is any other value

##### App.js

- It should contain a blue square
- It should contain a red diamond
- It should contain a green circle

##### Checking your work

This is where those unit tests I mentioned earlier come in. When you want to check if
your project meets the requirements listed above you can type in:

```bash
npm test
```

That command will kick off the testing script should output something that looks like this:

<img alt="unit test output" src="/images/react-part-4-exercise-1/tests.png" />

When all 14 tests pass, you are ready to move on to [exercise 2](/articles/react-part-4-exercise-2).
