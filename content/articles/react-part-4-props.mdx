##### Webpack Dev Server

Before we start digging deeper into React, I want to take a short detour that will save
us a lot of time in the long run. After going through the previous section, you may have
been thinking that it was something of a chore to have to run Webpack and bundle your code
every single time you made a change and wanted to see it. Fortunately, the makers of Webpack
have us covered. They have created another package, called Webpack Dev Server that will
start up a local server that will automatically be updated any time we save any changes.

Setup for Webpack Dev Server is relatively simple. First, you will need to install the package
globally so it will be available to all of your projects:

```bash
npm i webpack-dev-server --save-dev
```

Next you will need to update webpack.config.js in your project to have a few additional options.
Between the output and module sections of webpack.config.js add a new section called devServer:

```js
devServer: {
    static: __dirname + "/dist",
},
```

"static" lets the server know what the root folder for the local server should be. In our case we
want this to be the dist folder where our bundled code is saved. At this point, your full
webpack.config.js should look like this:

```js
module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/index.js",
  output: {
    path: __dirname + "/dist",
    filename: "bundle.js",
  },
  devServer: {
    static: __dirname + "/dist",
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        loader: "babel-loader",
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        options: {
          presets: ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"],
        },
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

Now that you have everything configured, we can add a new script to your package.json
to run the dev server:

```js
"start": "webpack-dev-server --mode development",
```

Once that is in place we can run the script to start the server:

```bash
npm run start
```

It should take a few seconds to start the server and bundle your code, but
once it gets going you can open your browser and go to the url
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), and you should see your
React application running there. Any changes you make should now automatically
show up on that page. Go ahead and try making some small change and saving it.

##### Props

Now that we have an easy way to see changes that we have made, we are ready to
take a look at props. Props is short for properties, and they are values that are
passed into a React component that can be used to modify what the component renders,
or how it behaves.

So far, all the components we have made have had static content. What I mean by that
is that the components will be the same every time. The HelloWorld component will always
display "Hello World!", and the NavBar will always display the same four links. This
severely limits the reusability of those components. Sure, I might be able to use something
like NavBar in a few places, but if I ever had a situation where I needed a slightly different
list of links I would have to create a new component with a lot of duplicate code. Fortunately,
props are the answer to this issue, and will allow us to create far more flexible components.
We will start by creating some simple styled headers, and we will work up to rewriting the NavBar
component from the last section.

Here is what we will be making to begin with:

<div id="example1"></div>

Start by creating two new files. A file named PillHeader.js in your components
directory, and a file named pillheader.css in your css directory.

PillHeader.js:

```js
import React from "react";
import "./css/pillheader.css";

export default function PillHeader() {
  return <div className="pillHeader">Hello World</div>;
}
```

pillheader.css:

```css
.pillHeader {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 6px 10px;
  background-color: #222748;
  color: #fff;
  font-size: 16px;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  border-radius: 16px;
  border: solid 1px #fff;
}
```

Next open App.js and update its JSX:

```js
return (
  <div>
    <PillHeader />
    <PillHeader />
  </div>
);
```

Save your changes, and when the page refreshes you should see this:

<div id="example2"></div>
Like our other components, this new component is still static and will always
display "Hello World". Let's add a property to it that will allow it to change.
Open PillHeader.js and update the function:

```js
function PillHeader(props) {
  return <div className="pillHeader">{props.value}</div>;
}
```

Then go back to App.js and update the two PillHeader components:

```jsx
<PillHeader value="Header One" />
<PillHeader value="Header Two" />
```

Save your changes and you should now see:

<div id="example3"></div>

As you can see, the way we apply props to React components is essentially the
same as how we add properties to HTML tags. It is simply a matter of adding:

```jsx
propName = "propValue";
```

to the component tag. Within the component function we are able to reference props
that have been passed in.

As the last example showed props can be a value that is directly displayed by a
component. However, that is not their only use. Props can also be used to direct
logic within a component. Let's update the PillHeader component to have an alternate
style that can toggled on and off with a prop.

First let's create some new styles for the component. Add a secondary style to pillheader.css:

```css
.pillHeader.secondaryStyle {
  background-color: #fff;
  color: #222748;
  border: solid 1px #222748;
}
```

Next update PillHeader.js:

```jsx
export default function PillHeader(props) {
  let style = "pillHeader";
  if (props.secondaryStyle === true) {
    style += " secondaryStyle";
  }

  return <div className={style}>{props.value}</div>;
}
```

Finally update the PillHeader components in App.js:

```jsx
<PillHeader value="Header One" />
<PillHeader value="Header Two" secondaryStyle={true} />
```

The result should look like this:

<div id="example4"></div>

Hopefully you are starting to get an idea of just how useful props can be. I
would like to note at this point that while the previous example does a good job
of highlighting how props can be used to control the flow of logic, it really
isn't the most elegant solution for swapping styles. As with most things in
these tutorials I am aiming to give simple examples that help to make clear the
core concepts of React, but they should not be viewed as the final word on how
to approach any specific situation.

##### Updating NavBar

Alright, time for one more example. We are going to update the NavBar we created
in part three. We are going to take it from a static component that can only display:

<div id="example5"></div>

To a component that uses props to control what links it displays like this:

<div id="example6"></div>

This example is going to be a little different from the others, because we
aren't going to passing single values as our props. Instead, we will be passing
an array of links. Let's start by updating App.js:

```jsx
export default function App() {
  const links = ["JonHirsch.dev", "Google", "React"];
  return (
    <div>
      <NavBar links={links} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Next we will need to update NavBar.js to be able to handle and correctly render
those links. We will map through the array of links that was passed and generate
appropriate JSX tags for each one. Here is the updated NavBar.js:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import "./css/navbar.css";

export default function NavBar(props) {
  return (
    <div className="navbar">
      {props.links.map((link) => (
        <a key={link} className="navbar--link">
          {link}
        </a>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Note that the anchor tag has an additional property called "key". Every time
you render elements as an array, each item needs to have a unique identifier
set as its key. This has to do with how React deals with arrays internally,
and helps it manage the elements. In this example I've settled for just using
the link text. I've done this for the sake of simplicity, but ideally you would
want some value you could know would never repeat, such as a unique id.

You should now see a list of links that looks like the example I gave at the
start of this section. However, right now your links don't go anywhere. They
have text and styles, but they don't have hrefs. We will need to pass those
to the component as well. We could pass them in as a second array, but I
prefer instead to send a single array of objects that contain the values we
need. Change the array in App.js to the following:

```jsx
const links = [
  {
    text: "JonHirsch.dev",
    href: "http://www.jonhirsch.dev",
  },
  {
    text: "Google",
    href: "http://www.google.com",
  },
  {
    text: "React",
    href: "https://facebook.github.io/react/",
  },
];
```

Now go back to NavBar.js and update the JSX being generated:

```jsx
<a key={link.text} href={link.href} className="navbar--link">
  {link.text}
</a>
```

The links should now be functional. That about wraps it up for this section.

To help you cement your understanding of props, I've created a
[couple of exercises](/articles/react-part-4-exercise-1). I would highly
encourage you to work through them before moving on to
[part 5](/articles/react-part-5-state).
