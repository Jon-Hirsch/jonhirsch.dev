##### Exercise 2: ShapeList Component

Like the last exercise, start by going to: https://github.com/Jon-Hirsch/react-part-4-exercise-2
and cloning or forking the repository then running

```bash
npm i
```

In this exercise you will be building upon what you made in first exercise. You should
begin by copying your code from Shape.js into this project. If you take a look at the
components, you will see that this time around I've provided App.js for you, but there
is also a new empty file named ShapeList.js. This is where you will be doing all your
work for this exercise.

ShapeList will be a component that accepts a list of objects that contain shape and
color properties, and will render Shape components based on those properties. For example:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ShapeList from "./ShapeList";

export default function AnExampleComponent() {
  const shapes = [
    { shape: "diamond", color: "green", id: "1" },
    { shape: "circle", color: "blue", id: "2" },
    { shape: "square", color: "red", id: "3" },
    { shape: "circle", color: "green", id: "4" },
  ];

  return (
    <div>
      <ShapeList shapes={shapes} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

will render the following:

<div id="example1"></div>

In the case of this exercise, App.js will be rendering two ShapeList components
that look like this:

<div id="example2"></div>

##### Requirements

##### ShapeList.js

- It should contain a blue square
- It should contain a red diamond
- It should contain a green circle

These requirements are tested using the following data:

```jsx
shapes = [
  { shape: "square", color: "blue", id: "1" },
  { shape: "diamond", color: "red", id: "2" },
  { shape: "circle", color: "green", id: "3" },
];
```

Hint: the "id"s should be used as the key for each Shape component.

Like last time, you can run:

```bash
npm test
```

to validate your code.

Hang on to these components once you are finished. They will be used again in the
exercises for [Part 5](/articles/react-part-5-state).
