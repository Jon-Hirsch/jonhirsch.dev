### Intro to React

Preface: I originally wrote these articles way back in 2016 in the early days of React when
class based components were the standard, hooks were yet to exist, and ES6 was the cool new
thing to be using. At the time I was on a team with several brand new developers who had a
small amount of exposure to vanilla JavaScript, and no exposure to React, NPM, or any of the
other surrounding technologies. I wrote these articles with them in mind, and strove to break
down in simple terms the differences between React and the vanilla JavaScript they were used to.
I've recently updated them to make use of more current packages, syntax, and features (e.g. hooks),
but the core content is left mostly the same.

For the last few months I've been working with React, a JavaScript library made by Facebook.
React aims to simplify creating and maintaining complex UIs by breaking down separate portions
into smaller reusable components. These components can be very flexible and can adjust how they look
and what they display based on the data that is passed to them. Using these components allows us to
make updates to the look, layout, and even functionality of our pages with very little effort. I could say
a lot more about everything React does here, but I think Facebook sums it up nicely on the [official React site](https://reactjs.org/).
I've found that React is a great tool for creating UIs without having to resort to complex and messy DOM manipulation
or unwieldy templates. It is however, very different from writing vanilla JavaScript and for the uninitiated it can be a
little hard to wrap your head around. With this in mind, I've taken it on myself to create a series of tutorials, examples,
and exercises to help introduce the core concepts of React. These tutorials are by no means exhaustive, as there are simply too
many topics that I could write about. Instead it is my goal to demystify some of the major pieces of a React project and their uses.
After going through these tutorials, you should be able to configure and write your own basic projects in React.

##### NPM

Before we can get started with React there are a few things we need to install. The first
thing we will want to get is a package manager. A package manager is an application that
lets developers easily install, update, and uninstall code packages that have been made
available by other developers. React is available as one of these packages, as well as many
of the other tools we will use alongside React. For the purposes of these tutorials, we will
be using NPM. NPM is the Node Package Manager and is part of NodeJS. It is available for free
from the [Node download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Go ahead and download and install Node now.

Now that you have Node installed, we can get a project started. Open up a command line, and
navigate into the directory you wish to use for your project. Type the following into your
command line:

```bash
npm init
```

You should be met with a series of prompts asking you for information about your project.
Go ahead and fill out the project name and other info. Feel free to just hit enter to use
the default values. When that is done npm will generate a file called package.json that should
look something like this:

```js
{
  "name": "react-boilerplate",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

This file will contain a list of all the packages used by your project, as well as a list
of any scripts you set up. We will be coming back to it in not too long.

##### Webpack

The next piece we will need is a bundler. A bundler takes all our installed modules as well
as all of our own code that is spread across numerous files, and rolls them into a handful
of manageable files. This will give us the huge advantage of being able to write our React
components in their own easily organized files without having to worry about adding a huge
mess of script tags when we actually want to add the scripts to our site. For our project,
all of our react files will actually bundle down into a single js file. There are several
packages out there that can do this kind of bundling, but for this project we will use
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

So now that we know what Webpack is, we need to get it installed on our project. This is
where NPM comes in. Webpack is one of those packages we talked about earlier, and we can easily
install it using NPM. All you need to do is make sure you are still in your project directory,
and type in:

```bash
npm i webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

It's as simple as that. Let's take a deeper look at what you just typed in. "npm i" is the command
to install a package, and webpack and webpack-cli are the names of the packages you were installing.
webpack-cli is another package that is frequently installed with Webpack. It extends Webpack's functionality,
and will let us set up a custom configuration file later, but you don't really need to worry about it now.
There are multitudes of other packages that can be installed just as easily, giving us access to all manner
of tools. I still haven't explained the "--save-dev" portion of what you typed yet, so let's talk
about that. There are three options that can be used in npm to dictate how to save a package :
"-g", "--save" and "--save-dev". "-g" stands for global, and will install the package on your computer,
and make it available in any project you are working in. the other two commands will add the packages
as a dependency to your current project, but nowhere else. The difference between "--save" and
"--save-dev" is that "--save" will save the package as a general dependency that will end up as
part of your bundled code. When we add React to the project, it will be one of these dependencies.
The other option "--save-dev" will add a package as a development dependency. A development dependency
is needed to build or test a project (or do other development tasks), but is not actually needed at runtime.
Webpack counts as a dev dependency, as it will be used to bundle our project, but it is not part of the
bundle itself.

Next we'll need a script that runs webpack, in the scripts section of your package.json file add the following:

```js
"build": "webpack --mode production"
```

We will be able to run this script from the command line using NPM.

Finally, we are going to need a Webpack configuration file. By default Webpack will check for a configuration file
named webpack.config.js. Go ahead and create a new file in the root of your project called webpack.config.js and
type in the following:

```js
module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/index.js",
  output: {
    path: __dirname + "/dist",
    filename: "bundle.js",
  },
};
```

There are only a few options being set here right now, but let's take a look at what they are. "entry"
is the JavaScript file where all the bundling will begin. We only have file, so that's an easy choice
right now. In the output section we have two options to look at. The first, "path", is where the bundled
output will be sent. In this case we have said to put it in a folder called dist within the root directory.
The last option is "filename", which is simply what name you want the bundled JavaScript file to have.

Now that webpack is installed and we have a config file and ascript to run it let's try bundling a file.
The first thing we will need is a file to bundle. Make a new directory in your project named src and add
a file named index.js. Go ahead and write any JavaScript code you like in index.js, it can be a console
log or anything, it's not important at this point. Once you have a file, go back to your command line and enter:

```bash
npm run build
```

When this runs, you should see a new directory named dist containing a file named bundle.js appear in your project.
This is your bundled JavaScript file. Right now it's only one file being bundled, which isn't terribly useful, but
when we start creating components it's going to be very helpful.

That just about wraps things up for this section. In the next section I will talk about
[Babel, JSX, and React](../react-part-2-babel-jsx-and-react). You can see all my code for
this section at https://github.com/Jon-Hirsch/react-boilerplate-part-1.
